This project is a Recipe Search website where users can search for recipes based on ingredients, diet, and cuisine. The website allows users to input ingredients separated by commas, and it filters through a list of pre-defined recipes to find matches. Users can also favorite recipes they like or upload new recipes for admins to approve. The front-end is styled for a smooth and visually appealing user experience.
